# mcp-server-devtools

Single-binary MCP server (`mcp-devtools`) exposing Atlassian, Zoom, CircleCI,
Slack, Postman, edX, New Relic, Grafana, SonarQube, Splunk, NinjaOne, and WRDS.
Ports of the TS reference servers with byte-for-byte parity on tool descriptions,
schemas, output formats, and error envelopes — preserve that parity when touching
anything LLM-facing.

## Toolchain & baseline (match it, don't fragment it)

- Rust is **pinned**: `rust-toolchain.toml` → `1.95.0`, `edition = "2024"`,
  `rust-version = "1.95"`. Use stable only — no nightly/unstable/preview features.
- Dependencies are **exact-pinned** (`=x.y.z`) on purpose. When adding/upgrading a
  dep, pin it the same way and update `Cargo.lock` deliberately; don't loosen
  existing pins to a range.
- "Use latest features" means latest *stable* idioms within this pinned baseline
  (edition 2024 patterns, current async runtime) — it does **not** mean bumping to
  newer toolchain/crate versions ad hoc. Raising the baseline is its own reviewed change.

## Build / test / lint (CI gates — all must pass with zero warnings)

```bash
cargo build                                   # default features (keychain on)
cargo build --no-default-features             # headless / keychain-off path
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings     # warnings are errors; pedantic is on
cargo test                                    # full suite (integration-heavy)
cargo fmt --all                               # rustfmt is the formatter of record
cargo deny check                              # license + advisory gate (deny.toml)
```

## Profiling (not a CI gate)

`benches/` holds two hand-run profiling harnesses, not pass/fail benchmarks
(`harness = false`, each has its own `main`). The test suite is a poor profiling
target — it builds at `opt-level = 0`, spins a runtime per `#[tokio::test]`, and
`wiremock` puts a real loopback HTTP server in every stack — so these run the
pipeline directly against synthetic payloads instead.

```bash
cargo bench --bench response_pipeline   # bytes + allocation count + ms per stage
cargo bench --bench toon_encode_loop    # tight encode loop to attach a profiler to
```

`response_pipeline` measures each stage against the shape it had before the
pipeline was de-allocated, so an allocation regression is visible and not just a
timing wobble. `[profile.bench]` keeps debug symbols (`release` strips them), so
a sampling profiler resolves frames:

```bash
./target/release/deps/toon_encode_loop-<hash> 14 &
/usr/bin/sample $! 10 1 -f /tmp/toon.txt   # built into macOS; no sudo, no SIP fight
samply record ./target/release/deps/toon_encode_loop-<hash> 10   # interactive flamegraph
```

The TOON encoder is the pipeline's dominant cost, so it has its own target.
`serde_toon_format` replaced `toon-format` 0.5.0 here: the old crate treated `-`
as a structural character and quoted every string containing a hyphen (Jira
keys, UUIDs, ISO dates, repo slugs, branch names). Measured against the TS
reference `@toon-format/toon` over a 489-case corpus, the old crate matched 401
and the current one 449, with **zero** cases the old one encoded correctly and
the current one gets wrong. `tests/toon_golden_tests.rs` locks the exact output
bytes and records the three classes that still differ from the reference — all
of them extra quoting or an alternate empty-array spelling, none of them
information-losing.

Note `serde_json/preserve_order` arrives via the encoder crate. Key order is
insertion order, not sorted; `object_key_order_is_preserved_not_sorted` fails if
a dependency change drops it.

CI (`.github/workflows/rust.yml`) runs build + clippy + test on a
ubuntu/macos/windows matrix; Linux also builds `--no-default-features`. "No
compile-time warning or error" is enforced by `-D warnings` — clippy `all` +
`pedantic` are `warn` (see `[lints]` in `Cargo.toml`); a handful are explicitly
allowed there, so prefer fixing over adding new `#[allow(...)]`.

## Releasing (one version number, not three)

`Cargo.toml`'s `version` is the **single source of truth**. `src/constants.rs::VERSION`
derives from it via `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`, and that constant is what MCP clients
see in `get_info()`, what `--version` prints, and what the HTTP health banner shows.
Never write a version literal back into it — `binary_tests::version_reported_to_users_is_the_crate_version`
fails if you do. (Unrelated to the MCP *protocol* version, which is negotiated
separately.)

To cut a release:

1. Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, and build so `Cargo.lock` picks it up.
2. Commit both, and get them onto `main`.
3. Tag `v<version>` on `main` — the tag must match `Cargo.toml` exactly.
4. Push the tag. `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on `v*` and builds the
   Linux/macOS/Windows matrix (~8 minutes).

`scripts/check-release-tag.sh` enforces step 3, wired as a `PreToolUse` hook in
`.claude/settings.json`: it denies a tag-creating command whose version disagrees
with `Cargo.toml`, and ignores everything else (listing, deleting, log ranges, and
commands that merely mention tagging). It reads the hook JSON payload on stdin, so
to check by hand:

```bash
echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"git tag -a v1.2.3 -m x"}}' | scripts/check-release-tag.sh
```

This exists because the three numbers had silently diverged: releases reached
`v0.10.0` while `Cargo.toml` said `0.8.0` and the reported version said `3.1.0`
(inherited from the TS reference server at port time), so a released binary
introduced itself to every MCP client under a version that was never released.

## Per-phase allocation gate (enterprise plan)

At the end of **every** enterprise-plan phase (M0, A, B, …; see
`docs/enterprise-product-plan.md`), run the allocation probe and compare
bytes-allocated and allocation counts per stage against the numbers recorded
at the previous phase boundary:

```bash
cargo bench --bench response_pipeline
```

Excessive allocation growth is a phase-exit blocker, not a nice-to-have:
investigate any material regression (rule of thumb: > 20 % on any stage,
matching the §8 budget posture) before declaring the phase done, and record
the fresh numbers in the phase's PR/summary so the next phase has a baseline.
This applies to the enterprise repo too — its CLAUDE.md carries the same rule.

## Layout

- `src/vendor/` — per-vendor HTTP clients (auth headers, request/response shapes).
- `src/controllers/` — orchestration between tools and vendors.
- `src/tools/` — MCP tool definitions (`rmcp`), schemas, descriptions.
- `src/transport/` — stdio + streamable-HTTP (axum) transports.
- `src/auth/`, `src/config/` — credentials (OS keychain via `keyring`, gated by the
  `keychain` feature) and config/env loading.
- `src/format/`, `src/pagination.rs`, `src/error.rs` — output formatting, paging, error envelope.
- `tests/` — integration tests (`*_vendor_tests.rs`, `*_controller_tests.rs`, etc.)
  using `wiremock` for HTTP and `assert_cmd` for the binary. This is where new
  behavior gets covered.

## Conventions & priorities

- **Priority order: correctness > security > performance > brevity.** Don't trade
  away correctness for a micro-optimization; don't log secrets or tokens.
- **Architecture: follow hexagonal architecture and SOLID principles rigorously.**
  Keep domain and orchestration logic behind explicit ports, isolate external
  systems in adapters, and preserve focused responsibilities and dependency
  direction. Deviate only when doing so avoids serious side effects or a
  demonstrated, material allocation or performance problem; document the
  tradeoff where the exception is made.
- `unsafe_code = "deny"` in production. Test files that must mutate `std::env`
  (now `unsafe` in edition 2024) opt in locally via `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` — keep
  that confined to tests.
- **Async**: this is a tokio (multi-thread) app — use async for I/O (HTTP, fs,
  process). Keep CPU-bound/sync prep synchronous. For an infallible sync-prep +
  single tail `.await`, prefer `fn -> impl Future<Output = T> + Send` over
  `async fn`; do **not** convert when there's a `?` before the await, a branch on
  the awaited result, multiple sequenced awaits, or a fixed signature (`#[tool]`,
  axum handler, trait method).
- **Tests**: new public fn / bug fix / behavior change ⇒ a test. Prefer integration
  tests against real behavior (wiremock/assert_cmd) over mock-heavy unit tests. A
  bug-fix test must fail on the unfixed code and pass on the fixed code.
- **Parity**: tool names, descriptions, schemas, and error envelopes mirror the TS
  servers. Changing them is a deliberate, called-out change — not incidental.

# Rust Performance & Optimization Guidelines

When reviewing, writing, or refactoring Rust code, enforce these strict guidelines to prevent excess allocations, CPU bottlenecks, and synchronization overhead.

---

## 1. Allocations & Memory Usage

- **Default to Borrowing:** Prefer taking `&str`, `&[T]`, or `&Path` over owned types (`String`, `Vec<T>`, `PathBuf`) unless ownership transfer is strictly required.
- **Avoid Hidden Clones:**
  - Watch out for `.clone()` inside loops, iterators, or closure bodies.
  - Suggest zero-copy alternatives (e.g., `Cow<'a, T>`, `bytes::Bytes`, or referencing fields directly).
- **Pre-allocate Collections:**
  - Flag any `Vec`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, or `String` constructed in a loop or with a known upper bound that doesn't use `with_capacity(cap)`.
- **Prevent Frequent Small Heap Allocations:**
  - Recommend `smallvec` or `arrayvec` for collections that almost always hold fewer than 8–16 items.
  - Flag unnecessary `Box<T>` for small types or lightweight structs.
- **String Manipulations:**
  - Flag repeated `+` or `format!()` inside hot loops. Suggest using `push_str()`, `write!`, or pre-allocated `String` buffers.

---

## 2. Synchronization & Concurrency

- **Minimize Lock Contention:**
  - Keep critical sections inside `MutexGuard` or `RwLockReadGuard`/`RwLockWriteGuard` as short as humanly possible.
  - Flag any `.await`, heavy computation, or I/O performed while holding a synchronization lock.
  - Recommend holding locks in short, explicit blocks:
    ```rust
    let item = {
        let guard = state.lock().unwrap();
        guard.get_item()
    }; // Lock dropped here before async/heavy work
    ```
- **Lock Granularity & Atomics:**
  - Suggest `AtomicBool`, `AtomicUsize`, or `AtomicPtr` over `Mutex` for simple scalar flags or counters.
  - Suggest `RwLock` over `Mutex` *only* if read operations drastically outnumber write operations; otherwise, highlight that `Mutex` is often faster under low-to-medium contention.
- **Lock-Free / Channel Selection:**
  - Warn when using standard `std::sync::mpsc` in high-throughput async code; suggest `tokio::sync::mpsc` or `crossbeam-channel` instead.
  - Flag unbounded channels (`mpsc::unbounded_channel`) unless explicitly required, to prevent unbounded memory growth.

---

## 3. CPU & Algorithmic Bottlenecks

- **Hashing Performance:**
  - Highlight usage of standard `std::collections::HashMap` when HashDoS resilience is not required (e.g., non-web contexts, trusted integer keys).
  - Suggest fast hashers like `rustc-hash` (`FxHashMap`) or `ahash`.
- **Iterators vs. Allocations:**
  - Flag intermediate `.collect::<Vec<_>>()` calls in the middle of iterator chains. Chain operations lazily (`map`, `filter`, `flat_map`) and collect only at the final step.
- **Monomorphization Bloat:**
  - Watch for heavy generic functions with complex code generated for many type parameters. Suggest extracting non-generic helper functions (e.g., taking `&[u8]` instead of `impl AsRef<[u8]>`) to reduce compile time and code cache size.

---

## 4. Agent Instructions for Code Reviews & Refactoring

Whenever analyzing code or generating solutions:
1. **Highlight Hidden Cost:** Point out implicit clones, re-allocations, or broad lock scopes immediately.
2. **Offer Zero-Allocation Alternatives:** Show how to refactor owned structures to borrowed references or stack-allocated alternatives where feasible.
3. **Check Async Safety:** Explicitly check if a lock guard (`MutexGuard`) crosses an `.await` point (which breaks `Send` and leads to deadlocks/contention).
