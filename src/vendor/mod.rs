//! Vendor abstraction for proxied REST APIs.
//!
//! This crate exposes generic HTTP wrapper tools (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
//! over multiple REST APIs — the three Atlassian products plus Zoom and
//! `CircleCI` — that share transport and output conventions but differ in:
//!
//! - **Base URL** — fixed for Bitbucket, derived from `ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME`
//!   for Jira, etc.
//! - **Path normalisation** — Bitbucket auto-prepends `/2.0`; Jira passes the
//!   caller-supplied path through verbatim (`/rest/api/3/...`).
//! - **Error response parsing** — each product has its own error envelope
//!   shape(s).
//!
//! The [`Vendor`] trait captures exactly those three concerns. Everything
//! else (auth header, request building, body classification, raw-response
//! persistence, `JMESPath` filtering, output rendering, pagination,
//! truncation) lives in vendor-neutral layers and is shared.
//!
//! ## Lazy base-URL resolution
//!
//! [`Vendor::base_url`] takes the [`Config`] and may fail
//! ([`McpError`]). It is only invoked inside per-request transport calls,
//! never at server construction. This is critical: a Bitbucket-only user
//! must be able to start the server even when no Jira site name is
//! configured. Jira tools surface a clear "missing `ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME`"
//! error at tool-call time rather than crashing the process at boot.
